				<h1>Alarm Conditions</h1>
				An alarm condition occurs when an initiating device activates.
				This activates the building’s notification appliances.<br/> 
				The FACP indicates the presence of the alarm condition through messages it displays on the alphanumeric display:
				<ul>
						<li>Red LED, labelled Fire Alarm flashes.</li>
						<li>Tone-alert (piezo buzzer) pulses.</li>
						<li>LEDs on remote annunciators may illuminate.</li>
						<li>The alphanumeric display on the interface panel indicates an alarm condition.
						The exact manner in which the alphanumeric display reports information for the alarm condition depends on whether the system’s Display First Alarm Option is enabled.  
						</li>
				</ul>
			</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Display 1st Alarm Option</h2>
					If Display 1st Alarm Option is Enabled. The display alternates between two screens:
						<ul>
						<li>A tally screen indicating the total number of fire alarms, priority 2 alarms, supervisory conditions, and trouble conditions present on the panel.
						</li>
						<li>A detailed description of the first alarm received by the panel.</li>
						</ul>
					<strong>If Display 1st Alarm Option is not enabled</strong> only a screen indicating the total number of alarm conditions present on the system appears.
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Acknowledging Alarms</h2>
					Acknowledging an alarm:  
						<ul>
						<li>Records the time and date at which you observed the presence of an alarm, trouble, or supervisory condition on the operator interface panel and stores that information in the system’s historical log.</li>  
						<li>Displays specific data on the location of the alarm.</li>
						</ul>
					The FACP can be configured with either <strong>Global</strong> or <strong>Individual</strong> Acknowledge.<br/><br/>
					<strong>The ALARM ACK key is located just beneath the SYSTEM ALARM LED </strong><br/><br/>

					<strong>Global Acknowledge</strong>  One press of the ALARM ACK key acknowledges every abnormal point currently reporting an alarm status. 
					This is helpful when a series of devices enter an alarm state (for example, all of the smoke detectors in an area of the building) and you want to acknowledge all of them at the same time.<br/><br/>
					<strong>Individual Acknowledge</strong> The ALARM ACK key must be pressed to individually acknowledge each alarm. 
					Individual acknowledge must be selected if the panel is providing proprietary receiving service in accordance with NFPA72.
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Globally Acknowledging an Alarm</h2>
						Use the following procedure if the Global Acknowledge option is enabled on your system.
						<ol>
							<li>Unlock and open the enclosure door. Read the alphanumeric display on the interface panel. It reports the number of alarm conditions.</li>

							<li>Press the ALARM ACK key. Read and follow the instructions on the alphanumeric display.  After you press the ALARM ACK key, the system responds as follows:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The tone-alert silences and the alphanumeric display reports pertinent information about the alarm.</li>
									<li>The SYSTEM ALARM LED changes from flashing to steady ON, and all alarm conditions are acknowledged.</li> 
									<li>Pressing the ALARM ACK key again displays information on the next alarm. Continue to do this to review all alarms in the system.</li>
								</ul>
						</ol>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Individually Acknowledging an Alarm</h2>
						Use the following procedure if the Individual Acknowledge option is enabled on your system.
						<ol>
							<li>Unlock and open the enclosure door. Read the alphanumeric display on the interface panel. It reports the number of alarm conditions.</li>
							<li>Press the ALARM ACK key. A report appears. Read and follow the instructions on the alphanumeric display.  </li>
							<li>Press the ALARM ACK key again. Read the report data.  Repeat this procedure to review all reports.  Reports are displayed in chronological order.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Tone-alert silences when the last unacknowledged alarm is acknowledged.</li>
									<li>System Alarm LED is ON, but is no longer flashing.</li> 
								</ul>
						</ol>
				</article>
					
				<article>
					<h2>Silencing an Alarm</h2>
						When an alarm condition exists, various signals, auxiliary relays, the city connection,
						and the tone-alert may activate. The ALARM SILENCE key turns OFF all devices that are programmed to turn off when it is pressed.  Typically, this will be the audible notification appliances.<br/>
						<br/><strong>Depending on the programming of the system, some devices may not turn off when the ALARM SILENCE key is pressed. </strong><br/><br/>
						
						At a minimum, the following occurs when the key is pressed.
						<ul>
							<li>Turns OFF signal circuits (which usually connect to the Notification Appliances)</li>
							<li>Turns ON the ALARM SILENCED LED  </li>
							<li>Displays a message indicating the ALARM SILENCE function is activated</li>
						</ul>
						You should be aware that the following functions affect the operation of the ALARM SILENCE function:
						<ul>	
							<li>If a <strong>Coded Input Device</strong> (typically a pull station) activates, the <ALARM SILENCE> key may be ignored until this function has completed coding. 
							Notification appliances cannot be silenced when a coded station is in alarm, but silence upon coding completion.</li><br/>
							<li>If the <strong>Alarm Silence Inhibit Option</strong>, which is a timer that inhibits the operation of the ALARM SILENCE function, is enabled, pressing the ALARM SILENCE
							key is ignored until the timer expires. 
							The message “ALARM SILENCE INHIBITED” displays for a short time to indicate the action was not taken. 
							The message “ALARM SILENCE NO LONGER INHIBITED” displays when the timer expires. </li><br/>
							<li>If <strong>Waterflow Sprinkler Devices</strong> are activated, Notification Appliances may or may not be silenced (depending on local code requirements). 
							Usually, a dedicated bell will continue to sound to indicate water flow.</li><br/>
							<li>Some visual notification appliances may continue to flash until the system is reset.</li><br/> 
						</ul>
							<article>
							<h3>Using the Alarm Silence Key</h3>
							Press the ALARM SILENCE key and read the display. The alphanumeric display shows signal status and the ALARM SILENCE LED turns ON steady.

					<h2>Resetting the System</h2>
					The function of the SYSTEM RESET key depends on whether active alarms are present at the time the key is pressed.
						<ul>
							<li>Active Alarms Present.  Pressing the SYSTEM RESET key when alarms are present attempts to return the system to its normal state.  This includes resetting initiating devices
							, relays,
							notification appliances, and all LEDs and indicators that have been programmed to be reset with the SYSTEM RESET key.   
							See “Resetting a System with Active Alarms” below for more information.</li> <!-- Place href here -->
							<li>No Active Alarms Present.  Pressing the SYSTEM RESET key when no alarms are present causes the system to perform a hardware reset.  See “Performing a Hardware Reset” below for more information.</li><!-- Place href here -->
						</ul>
				</article>		
						<article>
						<h3>Resetting a System with Active Alarms</h3> 
						Devices in alarm can be reset using the SYSTEM RESET key.  Doing this allows the system to return to a normal state following alarm activation.<br/>
						Follow these steps to perform a System Reset when alarms are present.
						<ol>
						<li>Press the SYSTEM RESET key.</li>
						<li>One of the following occurs, depending on whether the activated devices reset or not.</li>	
							<ul>
								<li>If all zones or devices in alarm reset, the SYSTEM ALARM LED flashes, press the ALARM ACK key.</li>
								<li>If a zone or device remains in alarm and fails to reset, the “SYSTEM RESET IN PROGRESS” message is followed by the message "ALARM PRESENT, SYSTEM RESET ABORTED".<br/>
								When this message appears, the system remains in an alarm state.  
								The display indicates the total number of alarms present in the system along with a prompt to use the ALARM ACK key to review the points. These points do not require acknowledgement. 
								The SYSTEM ALARM LED remains ON to indicate that a fire alarm device is still in the alarm condition.  Read the display to determine the type and location of the device.
								Follow local procedures to investigate the area of the building in alarm.  Look for devices that are in an alarm state, for example pull stations with the handle down, 
								smoke detectors with their LED lit.  
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						</ol>

						<h3>Performaing a Hardware Reset</h3>
						A hardware reset reinitializes the state of certain hardware components and is typically used to reset a Class A Trouble, for example on a MAPNET, 
						IDNet, or RUI channel after the problem causing the trouble is resolved.  If you attempt to perform a hardware reset without first fixing the problem causing the trouble, 
						the hardware reset fails and the trouble reappears. <br/> <br/>
						To perform a hardware reset, press the SYSTEM RESET key when no alarms are present.

						<h2>Disabling a Point that Remains in Alarm</h2>
						<article>
						If a device remains in alarm and no alarm condition exists, the FACP provides a way to inhibit alarm reporting for the malfunctioning point. 
						Disabling a point causes a trouble condition for the point or zone that you disable.
						The <strong>DISABLE</strong> key, which is used to disable points, may be passcode protected.<br/> 
						Refer to “Logging In and Out of the System” for information on log in with a passcode.
						<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
						<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14295611/10102356/e3570fda-6395-11e5-9f0b-ec3f428aba4e.PNG" alt="Important">  <h4>Be aware of the following issues related to disabling points:<h4>
						
						<ul>
						<li>Disabling a point causes the point to NOT report alarm conditions or other status changes. 
						A point should not be disabled unless it is clearly understood that fire detection or security for the area of the building covered by that point will be lost. 
						Appropriate steps must be taken to provide alternate means of protecting the area of the building covered by the disabled point.</li><br/>
						<li>If the Service Reset option is enabled, an operator can clear an alarm condition to successfully perform a system reset, even though the device that caused the alarm remains in a trouble state. 
						A typical example is when a malfunctioning initiating device such as a smoke detector, consisting of a base and removable sensor,
						causes an alarm and activates the city circuit. 
						With this option enabled, the sensor can be removed and the system, including the city circuit can be reset. 
						Without this option enabled, removing the sensor would cause a trouble preventing the reset of the city circuit.<br/><br/><strong>NOTE: Service Reset is not a UL 
						Approved option and enabling this option on the panel invalidates the panel’s UL certification.</strong></li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Procedure</h3>
						To disable a point in alarm, follow these steps:
						<ol>
						<li>Press the ALARM ACK key to display the point’s information on the alphanumeric display.</li><br/>
						<li>Press the DISABLE key. The alphanumeric display shows the following message.<br/><br/>
						<ul>PRESS ENTER TO DISABLE <br/>MONITOR ZONE:  ZNXX</ul><br/>
						XX represents the point to be disabled.
						</li><br/>
						<li>Press the ENTER key. The alphanumeric display shows the action taken.</li>
						</ol>
						<strong>NOTE: </strong>The system indicates a trouble condition each time a point is disabled. It is important to repair the disabled point as soon as possible. 
						Once repaired, the disabled point should be enabled as soon as possible.
